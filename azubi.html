    <h1>My Favorite Travel Destination</h1>
    <h2>Greece</h2>
    <p>Greece is a country boasting some of the world's most beautiful islands
    and spectacular ancient archaeological sites. Thanks to its rich history,
    the vibrant country is full of attractions like the Acropolis, the archaeological
    site of Delphi, and the archaeological site of Mycenae.</p>

    <h2>Australian Marine life</h2>
    <h3>Christmas tree worms</h3>
    <p>CONTRARY TO their name, colourful Christmas tree worms (Spirobranchus) decorate
    communities of coral reefs all year round. And their value goes far beyond their good looks.
    According to Elena Kupriyanova, a senior research scientist at the Australian Museum whoâ€™s
    studied marine worms for over 20 years, these colourful creatures are first and foremost,
    protectors. Much like the complex tree-root systems of a large forest, colonies of
    Christmas tree worms create a calcium carbonate tube that penetrates the corals they
    inhabit where they can live for up to 40 years, depending on the size of the coral
    and reef health.</p>
